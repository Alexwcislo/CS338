Part 1:
    a) To execute the whoami command the first step is uploading the webshell (example given in the assignment)
        -Once uploaded we are shown: Target: uploadedimages/wcisloa-webshell1.php
        -Then I visit the url and add the whoami command:
            -http://danger.jeffondich.com/uploadedimages/wcisloa-webshell1.php?command=whoami
        -The result is I see www-data
    b) The pre tag is to identify that it needs to use a preformatted HTML style. 
        -Testing a webshell (in my case wcislo-webshell2.php) without the pre tag results in the same output, just different font and slightly different style

Part 2: For this part of the assignment changing the commands like above can provide the solutions
    a) danger's website is in the directory /var/www/danger.jeffondich.com
    b) The names of all user accounts on danger are given in a list (first part of uploaded images).
    I know because modifying the command to command=ls%20-la shows everything in uploadedimages and each user has (in theory) uploaded an image.
    c) I do not seem to have direct access to the file /etc/passwd. When I add the command cat%20/etc/password it says site can't be reached.
    However, when I attempt the command getent%20passwd to list users I am able to see some human commands like jeff but many system accounts like daemon, bin, syslog, etc.
    d) I do not have access to the file /etc/shadow. The file contains sensitive user information including encrypted passwords and other information about passwords like when it was changed. I know this from some quick research online.
    e) I was able to find the following secret files:
        - hi_jeff.txt and kindasecret.txt with ascii art in the secrets directory
        -secret.txt with some more cool ascii art in the youwontfindthiswithgobuster directory
    f) Other interesting stuff:
        -by using the command echo%20wcisloa%20was%20also%20here%20>>%20/var/www/danger.jeffondich.com/secrets/hi_jeff.txt:
        -I was able to add a line to this line to the hi_jeff file in the secrets folder that says:
        wcisloa was also here
        -By using similar commands I am sure I can modify other files or even modify directories

Part 3: Setting up for part 4

Part 4:
    a) The IP address of my Kali VM is 192.168.64.2. Ik this from running ifconfig.
        I confirmed it was 192.168.64.2 and not 127.0.0.1 because this allowed me to connect to the webshell.
    b) The IP address of my host OS is 10.133.7.247 i found out by running ifconfig and grepping with "inet". CORRECTION: Ip is 192.168.64.1 which also appears by running ifconfig.
    c) When I run nc -l -p 8000 i get an error saying nc: missing port with option -l.
        After a bit of looking online I found that my version of netcat is likely different and I can just run nc -l 8000
    d) Navigating to this crazy url at first did not work so I had to double check my ip addresses and found that to part b my os ip is 192.168.64.1
    e) After checking my host (listening) I see that I do have a shell, and from testing simple commands I am successfully able to run commands.
        I know I am on kali because the terminal now shows www-data@kali-cs:/var/www/html$ instead of my normal one.
    f) The % codes in the URL represent characters as per any URL programmed requirements. 
        For example %20 is a space.
        Others represent < or > or & which can be served for redirection purposes.
    g) The reverse shell functions as follows:
        -Attacker sets up/injects a webshell on the target (kali vm) machine
        -The attacker sets up a netcat listener on a chosen port
        -The target (Kali) initiates the conenction via the injected webshell by redirecting input and output to the attacker's ip and chosen port
            -this was done by using the crazy URL provided in the assignment
        -Once this connection has been established the attacker has access to the shell and
        is able to execute commands on the target machine from the attackers machine as if the 
        attacker were physically on the target machine
