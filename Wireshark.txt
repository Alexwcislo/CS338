===== DAYTIME =====

-Identify the parts of the TCP 3-way handshake by listing the frame summaries of the relevant frames. Your summaries should looks something like this:
3  10.0.2.15  129.6.15.27  TCP  [SYN]...
(i.e. the frame number 3, the source IP address, the destination IP address, the protocol, and the "Info" for the frame).

    - 1  192.168.64.2  129.6.15.28  TCP  41428 -> 13 [SYN]
    - 2  129.6.15.28  192.168.64.2  TCP  13 -> 41428 [SYN, ACK]
    - 3  192.168.64.2  129.6.15.28  TCP  41428 -> 13 [ACK]


-What port number does the client (i.e. nc on your Kali computer) use for this interaction?

    -Client uses the port number 41428


-Why does the client need a port?

    -Client needs a port in order to communicate with the server port (determines what service; in this case Daytime protocol). The client port is needed
    so the server knows who/which program on clients computer to talk to.


-What frame contains the actual date and time? (Show the frame summary as in question 1 above.)

    -4  129.6.15.28  192.168.64.2  DAYTIME  105 DAYTIME Response


-What do [SYN] and [ACK] mean?

    -[SYN] means synchronize which is used to start a TCP connection
    -[ACK] means acknowledge which is used to to let server/other side know the package has been received 


-Which entity (the nc client or the daytime server) initiated the closing of the TCP connection? How can you tell?

    -Daytime server initiated the closing of the TCP connection because it sends out the [FIN, ACK] first then client sends [ACK]. 
    This both happens before the client sends [FIN, ACK] and then daytime server finishes by sending [ACK]


===== HTTP =====

-How many TCP connections were opened? How can you tell?

    - 4 TCP connections were opened. I can tell by using the filter tcp.flags.syn==1 and counting how many connections are just [SYN] and do not have [ACK]


-Can you tell where my homepage (index.html) was requested? (If not, why not? If so, include frame summaries and/or other info that supports your answer.)

    - Yes I can tell. By looking through the different frames (with the help of using the filter http.request) I can see where the homepage was requested.
    The frame summary in the format (the frame number, the source IP address, the destination IP address, the protocol, length, and the "Info" for the frame): 
    32  192.168.64.2  172.233.221.124  HTTP 424 GET /index.html HTTP/1.1


-Can you tell where my photograph (jeff-square-colorado.jpg) was requested? (If not, why not? If so, include frame summaries and/or other info that supports your answer.)

    - Yes, following the same method as in the previous question I can see this request in the following frame:
    36  192.168.64.2  172.233.221.124  HTTP 463 Get /jeff-square-colorado.jpg HTTP/1.1



===== QUESTIONS =====

    - How can I tell if multiple TCP connections to same server are part of the same page loading or completely separate requests from different tasks?
    - Is there a way to determine if the packet is coming from the client or server without knowing the ip address or port of each?
    - How can I quickly see which frame contains the actual payload (ex. date/time in daytime protocol) without looking through frames and filtering?
    - I kind of understand the difference between a capture filter and display filter but in what kinds of situations should each be used?
